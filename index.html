                        I'm thrilled to have you here on my GitHub!</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>I didn't always have a passion for coding. It wasn't love at first sight. However, I was captivated by
                the unique nature
                of learning to code, and as I matured, I realized it was an adventure I wanted to embrace. That's when I
                embarked on this self-taught journey to explore the vast world of programming. It has been an incredible
                experience of
                personal growth and discovery so far. I am fascinated by the challenge and the boundless possibilities
                that coding
                offers.</p>
            <p>One of my earliest projects was a website dedicated to my beloved furry companion, Tainá Amora. She's my
                best friend with four paws and a wagging tail. Through coding, I wanted to capture our special bond and
                create something unique. It was a heartwarming experience that sparked my passion for web development.
                Check out my <a href="https://github.com/valeridev/TainaAmoraCodes"
                    style="color: rgb(243, 112, 134);">TainaAmoraCodes</a> repository to learn more about the project!

            <h2>Certificates and Achievements</h2>
            <p>On my learning journey, I've achieved a handful of certificates that showcase my dedication and progress.
                I'm proud of these accomplishments, but I consider them just the beginning. There's so much more to
                learn, build, and achieve!</p>

            <h2>Explore My Repositories</h2>
            <p>I invite you to check out my repositories to see the projects I've been working on. You'll find a mix of
                personal projects, coding exercises, and experiments. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even
                collaborate on any of the projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.</p>
