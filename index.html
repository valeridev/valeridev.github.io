            <p>üëã Hi there! I'm <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/v%C3%A1leri-calhau-9279b927a/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer" style="color: hsl(210, 54%, 19%);"> V√°leri Calhau<a />, a self-taught
                    coder
                    on an exciting journey of learning and building.
                    Recently, I had the pleasure of working on a project during my time at SheCodes. It's called the
                    <em>Weather App</em> which was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and API.
                    I am
                    also in the process of finishing my Portfolio, it is responsive üì± üíª and hosted on <a
                        href="https://valerirabellocalhau.netlify.app/" target="_blank"
                    rel="noopener noreferrer"
                        style="color: hsl(210, 54%, 19%);">Netlify</a>. I welcome any suggestions or feedback you
                    may have
                    for it.</p>

            <br />
            <p>üí≠ I didn't always have a passion for coding. It wasn't love at first sight. However, I was
                captivated by
                the unique nature
                of learning to code, and as I matured, I realized it was an adventure I wanted to embrace. That's
                when I
                embarked on this self-taught journey to explore the vast world of programming. It has been an
                incredible
                experience of
                personal growth and discovery so far. I am fascinated by the challenge and the boundless
                possibilities
                that coding
                offers.</p>
            <br />
            <p>üë©‚Äçüíª One of my earliest projects was a website dedicated to my beloved furry companion, Tain√° Amora.
                She's
                my
                best friend with four paws and a wagging tail. Through coding, I wanted to capture our special bond
                and
                create something unique. It was a heartwarming experience that sparked my passion for web
                development.

            <h2>Certificates and Achievements</h2>
            <p>üìú On my learning journey, I've achieved a handful of certificates that showcase my dedication and
                progress.
                I'm proud of these accomplishments, but I consider them just the beginning. There's so much more to
                learn, build, and achieve!</p>
