# Welcome to My GitHub
ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm VÃ¡leri Calhau, a self-taught coder on an exciting journey of learning and building. Recently, I had the pleasure of working on a project during my time at SheCodes. It's called the [Weather App](https://github.com/valeridev/weathershecodesplus.html/blob/main/index.html) which was developed using a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and an API.  I am also in the process of finishing my Portfolio and it is responsive ðŸ“± ðŸ’» . It is hosted on [Netlify](https://valerirabellocalhau.netlify.app/). I welcome any suggestions or feedback you may have for it.
## About Me

I didn't always have a passion for coding. It wasn't love at first sight. However, I was captivated by the unique nature of learning to code, and as I matured, I realized it was an adventure I wanted to embrace. That's when I embarked on this self-taught journey to explore the vast world of programming. It has been an incredible experience of personal growth and discovery so far. I am fascinated by the challenge and the boundless possibilities that coding offers.

One of my earliest projects was a website dedicated to my beloved furry companion, TainÃ¡ Amora. She's my best friend with four paws and a wagging tail. Through coding, I wanted to capture our special bond and create something unique. It was a heartwarming experience that sparked my passion for web development.
Check out my [TainaAmoraCodes](https://github.com/valeridev/TainaAmoraCodes) repository to learn more about the project!

## Certificates and Achievements

On my learning journey, I've achieved a handful of certificates that showcase my dedication and progress. I'm proud of these accomplishments, but I consider them just the beginning. There's so much more to learn, build, and achieve!

I invite you to check out my repositories to see the projects I've been working on. You'll find a mix of personal projects, coding exercises, and experiments. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even collaborate on any of the projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.
