# Welcome to My GitHub!

👋 Hi there! I'm Váleri Calhau, a self-taught coder on an exciting journey of learning and building. I'm thrilled to have you here on my GitHub! Try my [weather app](https://github.com/valeridev/weathershecodesplus.html/blob/main/github4.html) my latest project that I did with SheCodes.

Let me tell you a bit about myself and what you can expect to find here.

## About Me

I didn't always have a passion for coding. It wasn't love at first sight. However, I was captivated by the unique nature of learning to code, and as I matured, I realized it was an adventure I wanted to embrace. That's when I embarked on this self-taught journey to explore the vast world of programming. It has been an incredible experience of personal growth and discovery so far. I am fascinated by the challenge and the boundless possibilities that coding offers.

One of my earliest projects was a website dedicated to my beloved furry companion, Tainá Amora. She's my best friend with four paws and a wagging tail. Through coding, I wanted to capture our special bond and create something unique. It was a heartwarming experience that sparked my passion for web development.
Check out my [TainaAmoraCodes](https://github.com/valeridev/TainaAmoraCodes) repository to learn more about the project!

## Certificates and Achievements

On my learning journey, I've achieved a handful of certificates that showcase my dedication and progress. I'm proud of these accomplishments, but I consider them just the beginning. There's so much more to learn, build, and achieve!

## Explore My Repositories

I invite you to check out my repositories to see the projects I've been working on. You'll find a mix of personal projects, coding exercises, and experiments. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even collaborate on any of the projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! I'm excited to continue growing as a coder and sharing my journey with you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect.

Happy coding! 🚀
